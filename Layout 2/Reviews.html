      <img src="Revival Eminem .jpg" alt="Revival Album cover" width="320px" height="320px">
       <p>  Few texts in hip-hop are as bizarre as Eminem’s debut LP, Infinite. Released on a local Detroit label in 1996, it was either ignored or dismissed by those who
 ejected his whiteness and his borrowed aesthetic. Were it released in 2017, it might be celebrated for its scholarship of the form’s early classics, a la Joey Bada$$ or Roc Marciano. Instead, he was written off as a swagger jacker who sounded too much like Nas and AZ.</p>

<p>The criticism burned, and from that fire he formed his alter ego, Slim Shady. A manifestation of Marshall Mathers’ inner turmoil, the persona served as a vehicle for his darkest, most violent thoughts and helped him step out from the shadow of his forebears to channel the darkest parts of himself. On 1998’s The Slim Shady EP, he found his unique and disturbing voice. It caught the ear of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, who spent the next five years molding him into one of the biggest pop stars in the world.</p>

<p>In those early years, for all the controversy his lyrics caused, Slim Shady helped Mathers focus his energy, a cathartic outlet that was both messy and intensely fascinating. But after more than two decades, he’s older, well-fed, and in possession of pretty much every accolade there is to acquire. The Slim Shady suit no longer fits; once the outsider, he’s now the establishment. If Slim Shady fed on hate, what does he do now that he’s beloved? What motivates a healthy, sober, 45-year-old father with enough money for several lifetimes?...</p>

      <p>Dive' brings the tempo back down for one of the best vocal performances on the album, while ‘Shape of You’ stands out so much on the record because it’s such a huge step away from Sheeran’s comfort zone: the insanely catchy, Marimba-fuelled percussion seems inspired by the time he spent in West Africa during his year’s hiatus, while the lyrics, although as simple as they are on his other songs, are more explicitly sexual than anything else on the album. </p>

<p>‘Perfect’ is a smooth tribute for Sheeran’s girlfriend that is, essentially, the singer trying to go one better than 'Thinking Out Loud' and succeeds with a less saccharine version of the slow-dance favourite (he doubles back on this for the cringey 'How Would It Feel (Paean)'.</p>

<p>For fans it will surely feature as a ‘first dance’ at countless weddings for the rest of this year and for several years after, but it also shows Sheeran as a shrewd businessman: the way he has mapped out each album from the beginning suggests a canny understanding of how the music industry works, even more so when you consider how Divide was pushed back so it would get its own space away from releases by the likes of The Weeknd and Bruno Mars. </p>
